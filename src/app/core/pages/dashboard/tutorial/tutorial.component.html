					<h3>Creating a task</h3>
					<p class="text-lg text-grey-dark">
						Create a task by clicking the "Add task" button in the top right corner. Besides the usual
						fields you probably already know from other apps like name, description and tags in Timeliness
						you set a <b>due date and a workload</b>.
						<br />
						The workload is the amount of time you expect to spend on the task. It is impossible to
						determine this beforehand with great accuracy, but that's fine, just go for an estimate, as you
						can always refine this later.
						<br />
						<br />
						When you create a task, Timeliness will add an event to your calendar representing the due date
						(indicated by the üìÖemoji). Also depending on your availability and workload Timeliness will add
						events to your calendar that block out time for you to work on your specific task.
						<br />
						These events are called "work units" (indicated by the ‚öôÔ∏èemoji in your calendar).
					</p>

				<div class="flex flex-col gap-8 md:px-4">
					<h3>Work units</h3>
					<p class="text-grey-dark text-lg">
						Work units play a central role in Timeliness. They are not only the main way to track your
						progress through a tasks life cycle but also a way to portion larger tasks into 
						<b>smaller manageable chunks</b>.
						<br /><br>
						After a work unit event has ended, Timeliness will ask you to review the work unit and decide if you
						are done with it. You then <b>mark the work unit as done</b> and the duration of the work unit accounts towards the tasks progress.
						<br>
						You can also simply reschedule it, if you didn't manage to work on it. 
						<br>
						If you only worked on a part of the work unit, you mark it as done and enter the amount of time you worked on it.
						Timeliness will reschedule the work unit for another time.

					<h3>Calendar features</h3>
					<p class="text-grey-dark text-lg">
						Having your tasks right inside your calendar is not only very helpful regarding visibility, but also very
						convenient for moving things around.
						<br>
						You will find all of the events, that Timeliness creates or moves <b>in a separate calendar</b>, that
						Timeliness already created for you, so they won't pollute your existing calendars.

						So what exactly can you do?
