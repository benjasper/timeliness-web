					<h3>Creating a task</h3>
					<p class="text-lg text-grey-dark">
						Create a task by clicking the "Add task" button in the top right corner. Besides the usual
						fields you probably already know from other apps like name, description and tags in Timeliness
						you set a due date and a workload.
						<br />
						The workload is the amount of time you expect to spend on the task. It is impossible to
						determine this beforehand with great accuracy, but that's fine, just go for an estimate, as you
						can always refine this later.
						<br />
						<br />
						When you save a task, Timeliness will add an event to your calendar representing the due date
						(indicated by the üìÖemoji). Also depending on your availabilty and workload Timeliness will add
						events to your calendar that block out time for you to work on your specific task.
						<br />
						These events are called "work units" (indicated by the ‚öôÔ∏èemoji in your calendar).
					</p>

				<div class="flex flex-col gap-8 md:px-4">
					<h3>Work units</h3>
					<p class="text-grey-dark text-lg">
						You will find all of the events, that Timeliness creates or moves in a separate calendar, that
						Timeliness will create, so they won't pollute your existing calendars.
						<br />
						<br />
						Work units play a central role in Timeliness. They are not only the main way to track your
						progress through a tasks life cycle but also a way to portion larger tasks into smaller
						managable chunks.
						<br />
						After a work unit event ended, Timeliness will ask you to review the work unit and decide if you
						are done with it. You the mark the work unit as done and it accounts towards the tasks progress
						or you simply reschedule it.

					<h3>Calendar features</h3>
					<p class="text-grey-dark text-lg">
						Having your right in your calendar is not only very helpful regarding visibility, but also very
						convenient for moving things around.
						<br />
						<br />
						So what exactly can you do?
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc text-grey-dark pl-16">
						<li class="text-lg">
							You can move work units and due dates around as much as you like. They are all synced back
							to Timeliness.
						</li>
						<li class="text-lg">
							You can delete work units, which reduces the tasks workload or even delete due dates which
							simply deletes the task with all of its work units.
						</li>
						<li class="text-lg">
							You can move more important events or work unit on top of work units, wait a few seconds,
							and see them automatically reschedule.
						</li>
						<li class="text-lg">
							You can move work units directly next to each other (or overlap them) as merge them together
							to one work unit.
